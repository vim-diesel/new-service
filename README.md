# new-service


This is built using code from [ardanlabs/service](https://github.com/ardanlabs/service)

## Description

This project has been modified to use [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/) database, as this is just a hobby project we don't need to host our own database, or run the service in Kubernetes.

Instead it will be run using a cheaper alternative such as [Fly.io](https://fly.io) or Google Cloud Run.
